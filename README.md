This project is one of my early ventures into web development as I learn HTML. It showcases my progress in understanding and implementing HTML, CSS, and a small JavaScript snippet. Through this project, I aimed to grasp the fundamentals of web development and apply them to create a functional webpage.

By utilizing HTML, I structured the content of the webpage, including headings, paragraphs, images, and links. CSS was used to enhance the visual presentation, applying styles, colors, and layout to the HTML elements. I also implemented responsive web design techniques to ensure the webpage adapts smoothly to different screen sizes and devices.

The navigation menu, created using HTML unordered lists and CSS, allows easy navigation within the page. Images were incorporated using the HTML img tag, and clickable links were added using the HTML a tag for both internal navigation and external resources.

Overall, this project demonstrates my early efforts in learning HTML and lays the foundation for further exploration of web development concepts and techniques. It serves as a testament to my progress in understanding and applying HTML to create basic web pages.
